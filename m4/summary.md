# initial planning:
Based on the provided materials, it seems that the "Using LLMs 101" course should aim to give a broad introduction to generative AI and large language models (LLMs) to an audience of engineers who may not have prior experience with these technologies. The course should cover the fundamentals in an accessible way, while also providing opportunities for students to dive deeper if desired.

Key topics and elements to include:

1. Overview of generative AI and LLMs 
- Explain what they are, how they work at a high level, and why they matter
- Clarify terminology (e.g. difference between general AI and narrow AI)
- Provide examples of popular LLMs and their capabilities

2. Hands-on experience with using LLMs
- Have students sign up for accounts on platforms like ChatGPT, Claude, Anthropic, etc. 
- Assign exercises to get students practicing with writing prompts, tweaking parameters, observing outputs
- Cover prompt engineering basics and best practices

3. Programming fundamentals 
- Teach basics of Python programming
- Show how to interface with LLMs programmatically via APIs
- Provide code examples and exercises 

4. Societal and ethical considerations
- Discuss limitations and potential risks/downsides of LLMs
- Cover topics like hallucinations, jailbreaking, filter avoidance
- Encourage responsible development and deployment

5. Semester project 
- Have students propose and build a simple but interesting application powered by LLMs
- Incorporate agile project management fundamentals 
- Dedicate time for students to work on projects and get feedback

The course can follow a hybrid format, with lectures covering concepts and discussions, alternating with hands-on lab sessions focused on using the tools directly. Curated readings, prompts and discussion questions can help spur engagement. 

By the end of the course, students should have a solid grasp of what LLMs are, how to use them in basic ways, and what kinds of applications can be built with them. They will get exposure to the key concepts, ethical considerations, and practical skills needed to start harnessing LLMs in their work.

# Discussion of possible assignments
Certainly! Here's a proposed list of assignments for the first module of the "Using LLMs 101" course:

Module 1 Assignments:

- Write 5 distinct prompts on a topic of your choice (e.g., generating a short story, summarizing a news article, answering a factual question)
- Run the prompts through one of the LLMs and observe the outputs
- Tweak the prompts based on the results and re-run them
- Submit your prompts, outputs, and a short reflection on the experience

1.3 Comparative Analysis
- Choose a single task or question
- Write a prompt for the task and run it through at least 3 different LLMs

These assignments are designed to get students hands-on experience with using LLMs right away, while also encouraging them to think critically about the technologies. The Python assignment sets the stage for later work on programming and building applications. The discussion component helps surface important ethical considerations early on.

# Feedback
we then implemented 1.1, 1.2, 1.3.

Example, here's the 1.2 assignment. 
1.2 Introduction to Prompting

1. Read the provided resources on prompt engineering best practices and techniques
   - "The Art of Prompt Engineering" by Anthropic
   - "Prompt Engineering 101" by OpenAI
2. Choose a domain or topic that interests you (e.g., creative writing, technical explanations, task-oriented dialogue)
3. Write 5 distinct prompts within your chosen domain
   - Aim for a variety of prompt styles and structures (e.g., question-answering, open-ended generation, role-playing)
   - Experiment with different wordings, levels of specificity, and lengths
4. Run each prompt through at least one LLM (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude)
   - Generate at least 2 outputs per prompt to observe variability
5. Analyze the generated outputs
   - Assess the quality, coherence, and relevance of the outputs
   - Identify strengths and weaknesses of each prompt
   - Consider how the prompts influenced the outputs

- Effectiveness of the prompt revisions
- Clarity and organization of the written report

Here's a breakdown of the rationale of the above assignment
Regarding the assignments outlined for the "Using LLMs 101" course, here are some insights into their design and purpose:

The Image Generation Exploration assignment is intended to provide students with hands-on experience using AI image generation platforms. By experimenting with different prompts and analyzing the results, students will develop a better understanding of how prompts influence the generated images. This assignment emphasizes the importance of prompt engineering and encourages students to think critically about the capabilities and limitations of these tools.

The Introduction to Prompting assignment is a cornerstone of the course, as it focuses on one of the most essential skills in working with LLMs: crafting effective prompts. Students will engage in an iterative process of writing, testing, and refining prompts, which will help them internalize best practices and techniques. By analyzing the generated outputs and reflecting on their process, students will gain valuable insights into the relationship between prompts and LLM performance.

The Python Programming with LLMs assignment takes an unconventional approach to learning programming. By challenging students to use LLMs to generate Python code before formally learning the language, this assignment highlights the potential of LLMs as programming aids. Students will need to break down problems into clear, step-by-step instructions and iterate on their prompts to improve the generated code. Through this process, they will not only gain exposure to Python syntax and concepts but also develop a deeper understanding of how LLMs can be leveraged for programming tasks.

These assignments are designed to provide students with practical experience using LLMs while also encouraging them to think critically about the technologies and their applications. By engaging in hands-on exploration, iterative prompt development, and reflective analysis, students will develop a strong foundation in working with LLMs and be well-prepared to apply these skills in real-world scenarios.

Next, a summary of the proposed course.
