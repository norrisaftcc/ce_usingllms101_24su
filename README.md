# Using LLMs 101 (Summer 2024) 

## Class Overview

## Introduction

This document provides an overview of our four-week class, "Using LLMs 101". This class is designed to give a broad introduction to generative AI and large language models (LLMs) to an audience of engineers who may not have prior experience with these technologies. The course aims to cover the fundamentals in an accessible way, while also providing opportunities for students to dive deeper if desired.

## Week 1: Overview of Generative AI and LLMs

In the first week, we will cover the basics of generative AI and LLMs, including signing up for accounts on platforms like ChatGPT, Claude, Anthropic, etc.

### Topics Covered

- What are generative AI and LLMs?
- How do they work at a high level?
- Why do they matter?
- Clarifying terminology (e.g., difference between general AI and narrow AI)
- Examples of popular LLMs and their capabilities

## Week 2: Hands-on Experience with Using LLMs

In the second week, students will gain hands-on experience with using LLMs.

### Topics Covered

- Assigning exercises to practice with writing prompts, tweaking parameters, and observing outputs
- Basics and best practices of prompt engineering

## Week 3: Programming Fundamentals for LLMs

The third week will focus on teaching programming fundamentals for working with LLMs.

### Topics Covered

- Basics of Python programming
- Interfacing with LLMs programmatically via APIs
- Code examples and exercises

## Week 4: Societal and Ethical Considerations

In the final week, we will discuss societal and ethical considerations related to LLMs.

### Topics Covered

- Limitations and potential risks/downsides of LLMs
- Topics like hallucinations, jailbreaking, filter avoidance
- Responsible development and deployment

## Semester Project

Throughout the course, students will propose and build a simple but interesting application powered by LLMs. The project will incorporate agile project management fundamentals, and dedicated time will be provided for students to work on their projects and receive feedback.

## Course Format

The course will follow a hybrid format, with lectures covering concepts and discussions, alternating with hands-on lab sessions focused on using the tools directly. Curated readings, prompts, and discussion questions will help spur engagement.

By the end of the course, students should have a solid grasp of what LLMs are, how to use them in basic ways, and what kinds of applications can be built with them. They will gain exposure to the key concepts, ethical considerations, and practical skills needed to start harnessing LLMs in their work.
