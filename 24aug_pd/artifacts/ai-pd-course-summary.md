# AI Fundamentals: My Dinner with Claude - Project Summary

## Course Overview
We've developed a 55-minute professional development course titled "AI Fundamentals: My Dinner with Claude," aimed at college faculty and staff. The course introduces Large Language Models (LLMs) and their applications in academia, structured around a meal-themed framework.

## Key Components Developed

### 1. Course Description
A concise, engaging description of the course was created, highlighting the unique "three-meal" structure and emphasizing the practical, hands-on nature of the session.

### 2. Session Objectives
Three main objectives were established:
1. Develop practical skills in using AI tools for academic tasks.
2. Understand ethical implications and privacy concerns of AI in academia.
3. Gain hands-on experience with LLMs through prompt engineering.

### 3. Detailed Course Outline
A comprehensive outline was created, dividing the 55-minute session into three main "meals":

- Breakfast: "The Copy-Paste Casserole" (Plagiarism and AI-generated content)
- Lunch: "The Rubric Ratatouille" (Assessment design with AI)
- Dinner: "The Confidentiality Souffl√©" (Administrative tasks and privacy concerns)

Each section includes demonstrations, discussions, and brief hands-on activities.

## Next Steps
- Further refine specific activities within each section
- Develop AI prompts for demonstrations and activities
- Create any necessary handouts or supplementary materials
- Draft detailed speaker notes for the presenter

## Additional Notes
- The course aims to balance humor and professionalism, using food-related metaphors to engage participants
- Emphasis is placed on practical skills, ethical considerations, and hands-on experience
- The session is designed to be relevant for both faculty and staff in higher education

This summary captures the main elements of our course development process so far. It can serve as a reference point for further refinement and development of the professional development session.
