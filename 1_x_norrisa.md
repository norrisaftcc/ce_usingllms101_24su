Can you summarize this article?
(Wikipedia HMMV)
Here is a summary of the key points from the Humvee Wikipedia article:

The Humvee (HMMWV) is a family of light, four-wheel drive, military trucks and utility vehicles produced by AM General. It was designed to replace various light military vehicles like the Jeep and has largely been used by the U.S. military since its introduction in the 1980s.

Key points:

- The Humvee was developed in the late 1970s to replace the aging fleet of military light trucks and jeeps. It had improved off-road performance, payload capacity, and survivability compared to previous vehicles.

- The Humvee first saw combat use in the 1989 invasion of Panama and was widely used in the Gulf War of 1991. Its original unarmored design was later found to be inadequate, especially against improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in the Iraq War.

- The military hastily added armor kits to Humvees, but this made them heavier, less mobile, and less reliable. The U.S. began replacing Humvees with Mine-Resistant Ambush-Protected (MRAP) vehicles starting in 2007.

- Despite its limitations, the Humvee became the backbone of U.S. military vehicle fleets, with over 280,000 produced. It has also been exported to numerous other countries.

- In 2015, the U.S. Army selected the Oshkosh L-ATV to replace the Humvee in frontline service under the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) program.

- The article also discusses various modifications and upgrades made to Humvees, including the addition of armor, gunner protection, and remote weapon systems.

- ## Prompt:
- You are a second year mechanical engineering student. Can you summarize the attached article about the HMMV, pointing out the areas of interest to you? Use only five bullet points.
- As a second-year mechanical engineering student, the following aspects of the Humvee (HMMWV) article are of particular interest to me:

1. Design and development: The article details the design requirements and the competitive bidding process that led to the selection of the AM General Humvee design. As an aspiring mechanical engineer, I'm fascinated by the technical specifications and the engineering challenges involved in creating a highly capable off-road military vehicle.

2. Powertrain and performance: The article mentions the Humvee's diesel engine, transmission options, and impressive off-road capabilities in terms of gradability, water fording, and top speed. Understanding the powertrain and suspension systems that enable such performance is directly relevant to my mechanical engineering studies.

3. Adaptability and modifications: The article discusses the various armor and protection kits that were developed and retrofitted to the Humvee in response to evolving threats, such as IEDs. This highlights the importance of designing vehicles with modularity and adaptability in mind, which is a key consideration in mechanical engineering.

4. Reliability and maintenance challenges: The article notes early reliability issues with the Humvee and the problems caused by the added weight and complexity of the up-armored versions. Analyzing the factors that contributed to these challenges would provide valuable insights into design trade-offs and the importance of durability and maintainability in military vehicle engineering.

5. Replacement and evolution: The article mentions the U.S. military's decision to replace the Humvee with the Oshkosh L-ATV under the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) program. Understanding the driving factors behind this decision, such as the changing operational requirements and the need for improved protection and mobility, would be beneficial for comprehending the life cycle and evolution of military vehicle systems.
