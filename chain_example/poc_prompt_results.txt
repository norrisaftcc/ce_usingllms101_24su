# Generate the blog post
print("5 Energy-Saving Hacks for Your Dishwasher That Will Slash Your Utility Bills")
print("\nTired of sky-high energy bills? Your dishwasher might be the secret culprit!\n")

topics = ["intro", "hack1", "hack2", "hack3", "hack4", "conclusion"]

for topic in topics:
    paragraph = generate_paragraph(topic, 5)
    print(paragraph + "\n")
```

This program does the following:

1. It defines a function `generate_paragraph()` that creates a paragraph by randomly selecting sentences from a predefined list for each topic.

2. It sets up a dictionary `topic_sentences` containing lists of sentences for each topic (introduction, four hacks, and conclusion).

3. It prints the blog title and hook.

4. It then generates five paragraphs (intro, three hacks, and conclusion) by calling the `generate_paragraph()` function for each topic.

5. Each paragraph contains five sentences randomly selected from the corresponding topic's sentence list.

When you run this program, it will generate a unique blog post each time, with five paragraphs covering the introduction, four energy-saving hacks, and a conclusion, all related to the given blog title and hook.
